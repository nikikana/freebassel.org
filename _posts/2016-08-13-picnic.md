GLOBAL - Saturday, 13 August 2016 - Friends and supporters of Bassel are invited to get together and have picnics in their cities in Bassel’s honor on the first ever #BasselPicnicDay.

\#BasselPicnicDay is a day to share food, drink, and conversation with people who care about Bassel, on blankets in the grass, in the sun. Let’s strengthen the ties of our community by coming together for a global picnic, and talk about who Bassel is, who we are, and why we need Bassel free.
