> GOVERNMENTS around the world use enforced disappearances to secure
> power and silence opposition. Journalists, human rights activists,
> lawyers, politicians, teachers, writers, and ordinary citizens are
> victims of enforced disappearances in countries including China,
> Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Mexico, Eritrea, Sri Lanka and
> Zimbabwe. Amnesty International campaigns on hundreds of cases
> around the world, and we call on our millions of supporters to help
> us remember them on The Day of the Disappeared.

> The Syrian Government has forcibly disappeared tens of thousands of
> people since 2011. Human rights lawyer Khalil Maâ€™touq was arrested
> by security forces in October 2012 in Damascus and remains
> missing. The whereabouts of software engineer and free speech
> activist Bassel Khartabil, first arrested in March 2012 and later
> moved to prison in Damascus, have been unknown since October last
> year.
