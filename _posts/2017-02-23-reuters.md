> "I am married, but to a detainee. He was arrested two weeks before our wedding on March 15, 2012," Noura Ghazi told Reuters. "Ten months later he was transferred to Adra prison in Damascus. We got married in prison."

> "There was a rumor he was sentenced to death. I know nothing," said Ghazi, a human rights lawyer who described her husband as a "peaceful activist".
