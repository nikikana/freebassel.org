On March 15, 2012, Bassel Khartabil was detained in a wave of arrests in the Mazzeh district of Damascus. He is currently being held at Adra Prison in Damascus by the Syrian government.

Bassel Khartabil, a Palestinian-Syrian, 31, is a respected computer engineer specializing in open source software development, the type of contributions the Internet is built upon. He launched his career ten years ago in Syria, working as a technical director for a number of local companies on cultural projects like restoring Palmyra and Forward Syria Magazine. 

Since then, Bassel has become known worldwide for his strong commitment to the open web, teaching others about technology, and contributing his experience freely to help the world. Bassel is the project leader for an open source web software called Aiki Framework. He is well known in online technical communities as a dedicated volunteer to major Internet projects like Creative Commons (www.creativecommons.org), Mozilla Firefox (www.mozilla.org), Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org), Open Clip Art Library (www.openclipart.org), Fabricatorz (www.fabricatorz.com), and Sharism (www.sharism.org). 

Since his arrest, Bassel’s valuable volunteer work, both in Syria and around the world, has been stopped. His absence has been painful for the communities that depend on him. In addition, his family, and his wife, have had their lives put on hold.

The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has determined that Bassel's arrest and imprisonment were arbitrary and in violation of international law, and has asked for his immediate release.

We, the signees of the #FREEBASSEL campaign, demand immediate information regarding his detention, health, and psychological state. 

We urge the Syrian Government to release the community member, husband-to-be, son to a mother and father, and celebrated International software engineer Bassel Khartabil, immediately.
